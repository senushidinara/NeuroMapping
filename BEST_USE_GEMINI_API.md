# Best Use of Gemini API â€“ NeuroMapping

## Project Overview
NeuroMapping is an AI-powered cognitive safety system designed to provide personalized cognitive risk insights. During MLH Open Source Hackfest, we implemented advanced AI models and integrated Gemini API for human-like interpretive reasoning.

## How Gemini API Was Used
- Converted raw cognitive risk scores from CNN + Transformer models into **digestible, actionable insights** for users.
- Provided **personalized explanations and social engagement suggestions** without requiring prior expertise.
- Enabled a **human-centric, beginner-friendly interface** for understanding cognitive health risk factors.
- Allowed seamless integration of AI-driven recommendations with visual dashboards for real-time feedback.

## Prize Justification
This project demonstrates **best use of Gemini API** by:
- Translating complex EEG signal analysis into clear, personalized insights.
- Enhancing user engagement and social impact.
- Building an open-source, fully reproducible solution.

> All work was completed **during the hackathon**, no prior work or pre-existing solutions were reused.
