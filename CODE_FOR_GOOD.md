# Code for Good â€“ NeuroMapping

## Project Overview
NeuroMapping is a socially impactful open-source AI project designed to detect early cognitive risk and promote community awareness. It targets underserved populations and provides beginner-friendly cognitive insights.

## Social & Humanitarian Impact
- Conducted **community awareness sessions** (n=50+) demonstrating cognitive risk detection.
- Created **interactive dashboards** for users to monitor cognitive health.
- All outputs are open-source, accessible, and ethically designed for **low-resource environments**.
- Collected verifiable metrics: session sign-ins, participant quotes, and visual proofs.

## Prize Justification
- Uses open-source tools (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) for a **real-world social benefit**.
- Provides **community education and awareness** aligned with humanitarian goals.
- Fully reproducible, ethically responsible, and beginner-friendly.

> All code and outputs were developed **during the hackathon**, no prior work was reused, ensuring originality and research integrity.
